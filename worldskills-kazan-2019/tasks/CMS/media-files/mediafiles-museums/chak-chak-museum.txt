chak-chak-museum

The Chak-Chak Museum is located within the historical Old Tatar Quarter complex. Inside the museum, in a homely atmosphere guests can drink fragrant tea from a samovar and taste Tatar desserts such as the traditional chak-chak, baursak and kak-tosh made from almonds, prepared using the recipe of Tatar enlightener Kayum Nasyri. While guests drink tea and sample desserts, the guides share stories and examples about the typical ancient Tatar peoplesâ€™ everyday life, traditions, customs, and of course, the secret to making the perfect chak-chak and other Tatar dishes.
