Museum of National Culture

The museum is located on the site of the original Aztec building that was a part of Moctezuma's "New Palaces" complex called the "Casa Denegrida" (Black House) by Spanish conquerors, who described it as a windowless room painted in black. In here, Moctezuma would meditate on what he was told by professional seers and shamans.[3] During the Conquest, this Black House, along with the rest of Moctezuma's New Palaces was nearly destroyed.[4] This site was part of lands given to Hernán Cortés by the Spanish Crown as a reward for the conquest of Mexico,[5] and Cortés rebuilt the New Palaces/Black House complex in Spanish style, using much of the building materials of the old Aztec buildings.[4] Cortes’ son later inherited this palace, only to later sell it back to Felipe V in order to establish the vice-regal palace.[5]
Recently, excavations here and next door at the National Palace have unearthed parts of a wall and a basalt floor believed to be part of the Black House. More excavations are planned.[3]

This colonial-era building was named a national monument in 1931,[2] but when the new Museum of Anthropology opened the site was left vacant. Beatriz Barba and Julio César Olivé proposed that the space be converted into a museum featuring world cultures.[8] After renovation, the building opened on 5 December 1965,[9] with Barba serving as its deputy director until 1976[10] as the Cultural Museum, with rooms dedicated to demonstrating cultural artifacts from around the world.[2] This museum dedicated to the world's past and present cultures is the only one of its type in Latin America.[11] The museum has sixteen permanent display rooms and three rooms for temporary exhibits. Some of the rooms are dedicated prehistoric cultures remains such as cave paintings and implements associated with the origins of sedentary, agricultural societies. Other rooms are devoted to ancient Mesopotamia as well as ancient Greece and Rome.
In the Age of Exploration room, items from the time of initial European contact with the Americas are on display. For modern cultures, there are exhibits from all continents and some dedicated to cultures little-known in Mexico such as that of Samoa or New Ireland.[5][12] Since its founding, the museum has received over 12,000 pieces from around the world. These pieces include textiles, glass objects, porcelain, photographs, arms, kimonos, masks, jewelry and sculptures. Many of these objects are originals and some are quite old. The museum still receives donations of objects. One of the most recent is of board inlaid with mother-of-pearl from Vietnam.[5]
