Soviet Lifestyle Museum

The State Russian Museum (Russian: Государственный Русский музей), formerly the Russian Museum of His Imperial Majesty Alexander III (Russian: Русский Музей Императора Александра III), located on Arts Square in Saint Petersburg, is the world's largest depository of Russian fine art. It is also one of the largest museums in the country.

A unique place where every visitor can take a trip into the forgotten Soviet past. The Soviet Lifestyle Museum is located in an authentic Soviet "kommunalka" or in English, "communal apartment" with brick walls, old wiring and cast-iron wall heaters. Exhibitions here carry titles relevant to the museum: "USSR in Space", "Toys: Made in the USSR", "Bad Habits in the USSR", "The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" and others. The museum’s main goal is to evoke a feeling of pleasant nostalgia and positive emotions among its visitors as they look through items of a bygone era. Exhibits are not chosen based on any particular special value (although among them, some are quite valuable and even rare); the most important thing here is the history and emotions that each item brings to visitors who may or may not have experienced the heyday of the not-so-distant-past era.

Creation

The museum was established on April 13, 1895, upon enthronement of Nicholas II to commemorate his father, Alexander III. Its original collection was composed of artworks taken from the Hermitage Museum, Alexander Palace, and the Imperial Academy of Arts. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many private collections were nationalized and relocated to the Russian Museum. These included Kazimir Malevich's Black Square.
